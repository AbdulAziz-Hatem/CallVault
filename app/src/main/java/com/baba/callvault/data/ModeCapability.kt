/**
 * What each privileged mode can actually do — the single list the UI greys out from and the mode switch
 * turns off from.
 *
 * **Everything here follows from two measured facts, not from taste:**
 *
 *  1. ~~A Shizuku-hosted process cannot get an `AudioRecord` into RECORDING state~~ — true until
 *     2026-10-19, when the cause turned out to be the host presenting our package under uid 2000.
 *     `ShellAttribution` fixed it (OP9: carrier and VoIP calls recorded directly in the Shizuku host), so
 *     every capture-side capability now works in both modes.
 *  2. In Shizuku mode there is **no embedded ADB connection at all**, so anything that drives adb has
 *     nothing to talk to.
 *
 * Listing the capabilities that *do* survive is as deliberate as listing the ones that do not: it makes
 * "does a mode switch disturb transcription?" a question with a written answer.
